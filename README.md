## Linear Regression to Predict MPG.

Fig.1 shows the results of linear regression to predict MPG . The variables of vehicle length and ground clearance influenced to MPG values based on the low p-values. The slope of the model is not zero because the coeficients are positive values and overall this model can predict accurated mpg values due to R-squared (0.7149) is close to 1 , .  However, the dataset may not include other variables that can impact in the accuracy of mpg.

 ## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

In your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
