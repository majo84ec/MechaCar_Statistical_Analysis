## Linear Regression to Predict MPG.

Fig.1 shows the results of linear regression to predict MPG . The variables of vehicle length and ground clearance influenced to MPG values based on the low p-values. The slope of the model is not zero because the coeficients are positive values and overall this model can predict accurated mpg values due to R-squared (0.7149) is close to 1.However, the dataset may not include other variables that can impact in the accuracy of mpg.

 ## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils.

If we look  of t-test results for all the lots, the variance is 62.3  and this value meets the specification of suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch .However, a detail analysis shows Lot 1 and Lot 2 are both within design specifications and have same mean and median with variance withing of specification limits but  Lot 3 variance exceeds the manufacturer specs.
